                <p id="0d427c30-ec3e-4d41-b2d7-a5cddee0ff06" class="">Hi Folks, It&#x27;s 2021, We all agree on the fact
                    that React Came out as the most popular Library in JavaScript Scene for Good Enough Time. In my
                    reasoning It came on top Because, It was meant for scale people at Facebook, Designed It in a way that
                    really solves a critical problem, of all the models of time, Which is Re Rendering on the smallest of
                    changes that occur some where deep inside the Tree. This use to cause Cascading Changes in DOM, Which
                    would make code unreliable for Devs to Change on, Nobody would be interested to do changes in such a
                    messy system, Which in turn causes Dev Processes so slow down.</p>
                <p id="8f668a76-e590-45e4-8b1a-520088a04081" class="">Now that you have Heard the Story lets look, In to
                    Tech that Enabled this, If you go to React&#x27;s Home page you would see the Following things </p>
                <h2 id="1acb2f72-f824-4ace-89c0-899a790b61d6" class="">Declarative </h2>
                <p id="495b2802-9e70-47ec-afc9-437adc3e41b0" class="">To understand this we need to Understand what&#x27;s
                    the Difference between a declarative and imperative way of doing Things.</p>
                <p id="9ba997db-a902-4b9e-ac30-1d18b594d42b" class="">In a Nutshell, We can say that, We are choosing to
                    Loose control over Control Flow to make our code more Reusable and Performant , There&#x27;s a Saying
                    that you take better decisions by not Taking decisions at all.</p>

                <h2 id="8853f648-105f-40ed-a449-cd955976e816" class="">Component Based System</h2>
                <p id="a2237adc-0ec3-49a9-8b38-33a468c9f871" class="">FaceBook had Been Playing around with these sort of
                    things for a long till they got to React, They had a php Extension called Xhp, Which got you out from
                    the hassle of Opening and closing &lt;?php&gt; Tags all around the code </p>
                <p id="3d491dac-8fca-4441-864f-ff111ea5e75b" class="">They introduced a New type of Syntax where they passed
                    Html elements as functions. It worked out great for them. The Above extension also had a feature of
                    Making Components, Which directly impacted the contributed to the creation of Component based System.

                <h2 id="aa2d56e3-8ed5-41a5-9e27-5fb24bc6be9e" class="">Virtual Dom</h2>
                <figure id="649e1421-ca8f-4c51-8e7f-4d325ee2a2d5" class="image"><a

                <p id="8410991b-3172-4a22-adce-761854cb252f" class="">Before understanding Virtual Dom, Lets get hang of
                    DOM. It stands for Document object model, It basically represents the UI of the whole App as a Tree Data
                    Structure. It all works Fine and good until you add Complex Functionality to the App. To solve this What
                    React Developers Did Was they introduced a Virtual Dom which Calculates and Process everything that Real
                    Dom would do whenever a change happens. And choose a way in which Least manipulation will Happen in the
                    DOM and Hence Cause a Better end User Experience</p>

                <p id="9f23e859-54c1-40f8-8dfb-716498c8fdaa" class="">Its is one of those Features That Comes out of the box
                    in React, What happens here is the app Pre Renders the Whole HTML of the Page and Sends it to the
                    Client, Reducing the Render Cost that comes on to the user, It also Is used Heavily when we are
                    interacting with constantly changing data, These Days People are Using NexT.js and NuxT.js For Complex
                    Apps. Which Work on the Above Principle </p>

                    Nothing Can Go this Big, Without the contribution from community</p>

                    course It Wouldn&#x27;t have been possible without the Opensource Community we have around it.</p>
